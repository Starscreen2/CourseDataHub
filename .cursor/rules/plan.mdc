Discord Bot:

can you implement a feature to scan if courses are open every 2 seconds? create a Discord bot; I got the token, so it messages users on Discord once the class they want is open. This uses index numbers and the class status (OPEN/CLOSED). Implement a button next to the status Closed so users can enter their discord username for notifications (of the index number) when the class opens up. This part ensures they verify their discords and display a discord link. Don’t use a database, instead, store everything in an SQL file in a folder.

Limits:
- Each user only gets 10 class snipes




For Rutgers course schedule planner:
So what I imagine this to do is when I am looking at a course, I can click the add button, it popups a little calendar in weekly format, and I can add/remove courses to that calendar and hide/show that calendar. When I add the course, it will show its time in the correct slot, section, and building where the class is being held. Also, for closed off classes, make it grayed out on the calendar
and at the right corner of that calendar, there should be a button to export all of the index numbers thats added to the calendar
for example:
if the user added these two courses to their calendar: 13803 and 10756, it would be:
https://sims.rutgers.edu/webreg/editSchedule.htm?indexList=13803,10756
This link should be embedded into that button
There should be saved profiles and user should be able to make multiple calendars. It will be saved into the webreg links, and there should be an option to paste in the link and then show in the calendar.
what changes do I need to make to avoid errors

Course Planner:

Make the light/dark


Create a set of interactive buttons with a beautiful glow effect on hover. Each button should have its own unique color (blue, green, orange, and purple). When I hover over a button, it should emit a soft radial glow that animates outward with a spring-like motion. The glow should be more vibrant in dark mode.

The buttons should:
- Have rounded corners and a clean, modern design
- Include both an icon and text label
- Have a smooth animation when the glow appears and disappears
- Work well in both light and dark modes
- Be responsive and accessible

Include a simple demo page with a dark mode toggle so I can see how they look in both themes.

There's actually a subtle but important distinction between these two "Online" options:

1. **Type: "Online & Remote Instruction"** - This filter is about the instructional method or delivery format of the course. It filters courses based on how they're taught, regardless of which campus they're administratively associated with. This includes:

1. Fully asynchronous online courses
2. Synchronous remote courses (live video lectures)
3. Any course with no in-person component



2. **Campus: "Online"** - This filter is about the administrative campus designation. In Rutgers' course system, courses that don't have a physical location are designated with "Online" as their campus instead of one of the physical campuses (College Ave, Busch, etc.).


The distinction matters because:

- A course might be designated as being on the "Online" campus but could have synchronous meeting times (like scheduled Zoom sessions)
- A course might be taught entirely online but still be administratively associated with a specific physical campus
- Some hybrid courses might have both online components and in-person components on a physical campus
